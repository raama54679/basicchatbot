# basicchatbot

By the end of this you should have a basic groq chatbot(or other model of your choosing) that works in your terminal.

Installation of libraries: 
This will be the most difficult part of the project. I recommend creating a requirements.txt file and 
trying to pip install -r the file from terminal. 

Getting API KEY: 
Create a .env file to hold your key and model name. 
Go to GROQ Cloud Playground and sign up for free.
Once you have an API key and model, add them to a .env file. 
Also add other variables relevant to your model like MAX_TOKENS and TEMPERATURE.

Once this is all completed the application should run just fine.
